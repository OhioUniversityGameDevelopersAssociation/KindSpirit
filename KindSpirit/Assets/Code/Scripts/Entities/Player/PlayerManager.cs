 * Playter Manager keeps track of all playerstats 
 * and handles different events regarding the player
 * including restricting controls, respawning, and more.
 * Most variables in this script are private to ensure 
 * that if they are going to be modified, it is with 
 * correct intension. We don't want unexpected things
 * happening to out player. Stores movement and attack
 * in seperate Vector2's but can easily be adapted to
 * Vector3's by the script utilizing those properties.
